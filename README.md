# **Klist (E-Commerce) Analysis - Excel**

Klist is an e-commerce company that sells popular electronics to global customers. In this project, I analyzed a sample dataset to investigate trends and growth rates (e.g. YoY, MoM) to surface insights on the company's performance. The key areas of the analysis were the following: 

- Sales Revenue
- Average Order Value (AOV)
- Product Popularity
- Operational Performance
- Marketing Channels

In addition, I investigated the effectiveness of the company’s loyalty program to provide recommendations on the continuation of the program.

I used Pivot Tables, conditional formatting, aggregation functions, VLOOKUP, and statistical analysis to clean, analyze, and summarize the insights below, to deliver to the finance, marketing, operations, and product teams.

# **Summary of Insights**

**Sales Trends**: 
- Over the last four years (2019-2022), the average annual sales reached 18.5K orders with yearly sales of $4.8 million and an average order value of $226. 
- 2021 was a stand-out year with the highest number of sales (30K), while 2020 exhibited the highest average order value ($298). 

**Seasonality**:
- The spring and winter months tend to have higher sales, likely due to holiday gift-buying and promotions, and there was a spike in the average sale price in January and February 2020, possibly related to pandemic purchases.

**Product Trends**:
- From 2020 to 2022, the 27in 4K Gaming Monitor brought in the most amount of revenue. Across all four years, Apple Airpods Headphones consistently ranked as the best-selling product (based on order count). 
On the other hand, Bose Soundsport Headphones accounted for less than 1% of total sales and orders** each year. 

**Loyalty Program**:
- The loyalty program is trending positively and gained traction in 2021 as it generated an additional $506K compared to non-loyalty program sales. 
- In 2022, the loyalty program produced $523K more than non-loyalty program sales and also saw more expensive sales ($34 more in AOV).

**Marketing Trends**:
- The marketing channels that consistently drive the most sales revenue each year are direct and email. 
- Across all four years, direct marketing has accounted for $19.8M in sales while email marketing for $2.8M in sales.

# **Recommendations & Next Steps**

- With overall sales revenue declining from the previous years, consider shifting focus on higher-performing products ( and cutting low-performing products (e.g., Bose Soundsport Headphones: <1% of total sales). While the Macbook Air Laptops only account for 4% of total orders, it is the third most revenue-generating product with $5.3M in sales (22% of total sales). The team should explore options to increase orders for these laptops, and potentially conduct a competitive analysis to replace the low-performing products or run promos to facilitate sales.
- Continue the loyalty program, as these customers make more purchases and spend more on average even with the program discount. Consider exploring options to expand the program’s benefits to incentivize sales and returning customers, such as incorporating reward points, product deals, or other exclusive discounts.
- Investments should continue in direct and email marketing as these are the top-performing marketing channels each year. Since social media is an underperforming channel that generates less than 2% of total sales, the marketing team should consider developing actionable key performance indicators (KPIs), researching/understanding more about its target customer segments, and revamping its social media strategy on relevant platforms.
- While APAC is one of the lowest sales regions, it has the most expensive sales (AOV of $279). Investigate whether there are features or promos to help make this region more lucrative.
